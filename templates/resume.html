            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <div class="experience-overview">
                <p>
                    I've been working for Czech startup <a href="https://www.goout.net">GoOut</a> for the last 4 years
                    as a developer. I join the company as first "hired" developer, so I was part of the whole growing
                    and changing process. I started as Java developer, but I was also doing some basic frontend
                    (Javascript, jQuery, Freemarker templating system). We were using our DIY solutions: maintaining
                    database servers (MySQL/Percona), manually deploing and taking care of our Linux servers. As the
                    product and team grew, I moved fully to backend positions and left my frontend days behind, still
                    doing some smaller devops things.
                    </br>
                    A lot has changed since then (for the better), we grew up as team, we migrated to Kotlin, split our
                    monolith app into microservices and started with all these fancy new technologies. I had a chance
                    to take leading role in a small team and help new people with onboarding. We end up using Google
                    Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Docker and GitLab CI, doing proper code reviews and writing detailed
                    tech specifications.
                </p>

            <h3>Projects I've been working on</h3>
            <div class="goout-projects">
                <h4>Migrating Java backend to Kotlin</h4>
                <p>We decided to go on fully with this cool language (previously viewed mostly as Android solution) and
                    it was a great decision. We iteratively migrated all our code base, manually or using automatic
                    migration tools. There were few challenges but mostly it was a pleasure (we all love removing and
                    refactoring of code) and we end up with fresh language which is making developer life so much
                    easier.</p>
                <h4>Integration of PayU payment gateway</h4>
                <p>One of my first project was payment gateway implementation. It was a great experience to be working
                    on such important part of our system (and especially from the point of our customers). I was
                    struggling a bit with lousy documentation and missing sandboxes, but we end up with fast and
                    trustworthy solution. We even implemented "embedded" payment which looks like our native solution
                    (to make it more comfortable for customers), which hasn't been done before with PayU.</p>
                <h4>Implementation of Elasticsearch server</h4>
                <p>As we hit some limitation of our MySQL searchs/entity hydrations we decided to try
                    Elasticsearch for our listings and core endpoints. I was in charge of server installation and
                    backend implementation. I learned a lot about mappings (especially from mistakes I've made), setting
                    up new indices (reindexing, migrations, etc) and even few things about full-text search and some
                    search issues. We started with Elasticsearch as a secondary database, used for search speed up but
                    end up using it even as our primary source for specific cases.</p>
                <h4>Implementation of Kafka messaging system</h4>
                <p>As our code base grew, we end up in need to have some more "centralized" approach to different events
                    going through our system (like ticket purchase, or event like). I was working on the whole solution
                    integration with my colleague. We deployed our devel and production Kafka cluster and prepared
                    backend service to provide smooth developer experience.</p>
                <h4>Implementation of Firebase live DB and cloud messaging system</h4>
                <p>As a company we were very tied with our Android/iOS apps and apart from creating APIs, we also needed
                    a solution for live ticket distribution for our scanner app and solution for mobile notifications.
                    We decided to go for Firebase, I created microservice to maintain our scanning
                    apps updated and pull all entry logs from the live DB. We also used Firebase for notification
                    distribution, where I implemented backend part of notification distribution into Firebase platform.

            <h2>Previous experience</h2>
            <p>I was working for 2 and half year for <a href="https://www.eway-crm.com/">eWay CRM</a> which is a
                Prague company working on it's own CRM solution for Outlook. I started as a part timer (I was still
                studying back then) and my job was to migrate from old CMS solution to new one. Preparing FAQs and
                user manuals for our customers. Then I moved to technical consultant/suport, I was helping with
                remote installation and was part of the customer support team (with worldwide clients). Finally I
                end up as a C# developer (partially helping with PHP), we had a great code review and it was
                interesting first "real" experience.</p>
